  The national flag of India, known as the "Tiranga," is a powerful symbol of the country's identity and values.
  Comprising three horizontal bands of saffron, white, and green, the flag embodies courage, peace, and prosperity. The
  saffron at the top signifies bravery and sacrifice, while the white in the center represents truth and purity. The
  green
  band at the bottom reflects the richness of the land and its fertility. At the heart of the flag lies the Ashoka
  Chakra,
  a navy blue wheel with 24 spokes, symbolizing the eternal wheel of law and the pursuit of justice. Adopted on July 22,
  1947, just before India gained independence, the Tiranga is not only a national emblem but also a source of pride,
  flown
  high during important occasions like Republic Day and Independence Day, reminding citizens of their unity and shared
  heritage.
